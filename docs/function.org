#+TITLE: Design of Function Class

* Goal
A generalized definition of function class for all practical purposes.
The base class should be defined as a purely abstract class, which contains only basic requirements
for a "function" for diagrammatic calculations.

* TODO Requirements [0/3]
- [ ] A function should be defined as a map from a set of coordinates to a value.
Thus a method which receives coordinates from an abstract class object Coordinates,
and return value in another abstract class object Val should be provided.
  - [ ] To keep code general, the parameter and return value should be defined as 
    abstract classed; in practice, Coordinates could be std::vector<double>, and 
    Val could be just double.
- [ ] A method should be provided to know the domain of a function, and the dimension
of the coordinates.
