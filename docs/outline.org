* Introduction
* Theoretical Analysis
  At current stage, this code is mainly focusing on Coulumb systems. 
The Hamiltonian would be
\[
H=\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \frac{p_i^2}{2m}+\Sigma_{i<j} \frac{e^2}{|r_i-r_j|}n_i n_j,
\]

** Jellium model
   As a starting point, we considered Jellium model, a much simplified Coulumb model, where a universal positive
background which exactly cancels the diverging Hartree term.

     \[
     \Pi = G_0 G_0
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{V}{1+\Pi V} 
     \]
     with 
     \[
     V= \frac{4\pi e^2}{q^2}
     \]
